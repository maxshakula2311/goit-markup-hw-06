Hello and welcome to my homework 6!
Thank you very much for this awesome project! It is
only the beginning, but I learned a lot of new things and had a really great time doing it. I had some troubles, but I managed to solve them. Now I'll prepare for my team project. I hope this is my final version of the website. Have a nice day!
